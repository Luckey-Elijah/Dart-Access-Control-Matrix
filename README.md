# Access Control Matrix âŒ—

A simple Dart-implemented ACM.

## Design

This section describes the designs and API of this program.

### `Roles`

The database system has three types of users: `user`, `securityOfficer`, `administrator`.

- `user`: Users who are allowed to perform only DML operations.
- `securityOfficer`: Manges users and passwords. Also, they perform backup and recovery operations.
- `administrator`: Perform the tasks of all the above.

### `Object` and `Subject`

The `Subject` class inherits all of the methods and fields of the `Object` class. There are two fields that are added the `Subject` class to differentiate it: `id` and `role` (*described later*).

### `AccessControlMatrix`

The `AccessControlMatrix` class is used to control and manage the `Subject`s and `Object`s.
